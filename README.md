Sales Data Analysis Project
1. Load Dataset
Command: Use pd.read_csv() to load the dataset into a DataFrame.
2.  Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Group by Categories: Use groupby() to group the data based on categorical variables such as Region or Product_Category.

Compute Statistics: Use .mean(), .sum(), or .count() to calculate statistics (e.g., average sales per region).

Analyze Data Distribution: Use describe() to get summary statistics for numerical columns. 
3. Visualizations
Line Chart (Trend Analysis): Use plt.plot() to create a line chart showing trends over time (e.g., monthly sales).

Bar Chart (Comparison by Category): Use plt.bar() to compare numerical values across categories (e.g., average sales per region).

Histogram (Distribution of Sales): Use plt.hist() to visualize the distribution of a numerical column (e.g., sales amount).

Scatter Plot (Correlation Analysis): Use plt.scatter() to explore the relationship between two numerical variables (e.g., sales amount vs. quantity sold). 
4. Insights Extraction
Trend Insights: Analyze the trends shown in line charts to identify seasonal patterns or periods of high sales.

Performance by Region: Evaluate the sales performance by region or product category using bar charts.

Sales Distribution: Investigate how sales are distributed across different values using histograms.

Correlations: Assess the correlation between sales amount and quantity sold through scatter plots to identify key relationships. 
5. How to Run/View the Project:
Install Required Libraries: Run pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn to install the necessary libraries.

Load the Dataset: Use pd.read_csv() to load the dataset into the project.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and duplicates using dropna() and drop_duplicates().

Run the Visualizations: Generate visualizations (line chart, bar chart, histogram, scatter plot) using matplotlib and seaborn.

Extract Insights: Review the outputs and insights generated from the visualizations and groupings.
